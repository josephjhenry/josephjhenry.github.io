        <h2>Working Papers</h2>

            <h3><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5384467">How much money is really left on the table? Reassessing the measurement of IPO underpricing</a></h3>
            <i>with Terry O'Brien</i><br>
            IPO issuers are thought to collectively leave billions of dollars "on the table" by underpricing shares relative to the initial trading price. However, this trading price corresponds to relatively small share volume. Because some investors are more optimistic about the shares' value than others, the trading price exaggerates the maximum feasible IPO price for the larger IPO quantity.<br>
After an IPO, we see an initial market price based on the trading of roughly 10% of the IPO quantity, and the IPO price often looks like it was unnecessarily low. It looks like the shares were greatly underpriced. But if you want to sell all the IPO shares at once, the IPO price probably needs to be lower than the initial trading price so you can find enough willing buyers for all the shares. Take concert seats for example. (And let’s assume all the seats have the same view, same quality.) If the price is high, only a few people will want to buy, the "superfans." If the price is low, you can sell more seats to a broader audience. If only a small fraction of the venue’s seats are available to buy at market pricing, then the price ends up being determined by the demand of the most enthusiastic buyers. But suppose you wanted to sell all the venue's seats at once. In that case, the price would need to be lower to entice a broad enough audience.<br>
We assess the extent of the mismeasurement by introducing a new measure of IPO underpricing that incorporates both share prices and their associated quantities. Using data from 2,937 IPOs from 1993-2023, our evidence suggests that IPOs are underpriced by substantially less than is commonly believed, perhaps up to 40% less.

    <h3><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4961899">Retail IPO Access: High Hopes, Low Returns</a></h3>
    <i>with David Gempesaw, Kevin Pisciotta, and Han Xiao</i><br>
    We conduct the first comprehensive analysis of Retail IPO Access programs that allocate IPO shares to retail investors at the same price as institutional investors. Retail IPO stocks underperform contemporaneous IPOs by about 20 percentage points in the first year. We identify two key factors contributing to this underperformance. First, the earnings-to-offer price ratio for Retail IPOs is lower, suggesting adverse selection of aggressively priced IPOs. Second, Retail IPOs experience higher pre-IPO Google search activity and greater post-IPO fractional trade volume, indicating attention-driven retail trading. While adjusting for adverse selection narrows the performance gap, it becomes statistically insignificant when accounting for retail trading. Our findings suggest both adverse selection and attention-driven trading contribute to the underperformance, raising concerns about the benefits of Retail Access programs for retail investors and whether these programs fully disclose associated risks.

<h3><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5049556">Weathering the Blow of a Disrupted Roadshow</a></h3>
<i>with Matt Gustafson, Emily Kim, and Kevin Pisciotta</i><br>
Exploiting weather-induced shocks to IPO roadshow interactions, we provide evidence that roadshow disruptions not only negatively affect investor participation, but also reduce ownership breadth and equity prices, both in the IPO period and during the subsequent year. These effects are strongest for issuers with low institutional backing and generate a multi-year path dependency whereby roadshow disruptions lead to less liquidity, equity financing, and capital expenditures. These long-run benefits to IPO roadshow participation highlight a new and important channel through which IPO issuers benefit from roadshows when transitioning to public ownership.
