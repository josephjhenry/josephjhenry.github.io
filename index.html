    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
<p>Joseph J. Henry joined the Finance group at Northeastern University's D'Amore-McKim School of Business in fall 2023. Previously, he was an Assistant Professor of Finance at Rowan University.</p>
<p>Joe's teaching expertise is in corporate finance, and he enjoys making an impact in the classroom. Joe conducts research on topics in empirical corporate finance (initial public offerings and shareholder payouts).</p>
<p>Joe earned his Ph.D. in Finance at The Pennsylvania State University. He is also an alumnus of West Virginia University (M.S. Finance) and the University of California, Irvine (B.A. Business Economics). Before starting his graduate education, he worked at a boutique investment bank in the areas of accounting and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>Outside of finance, Joe enjoys playing beach volleyball. While he appreciates the majesty of Fenway Park, Joe has been a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers since he wore his first cap and jersey at just 9 weeks old. Regrettably, his wife is a Yankee fan.</p>
